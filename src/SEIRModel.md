# LEMMA

LEMMA (Local Epidemic Modeling for Management and Action) is designed to provide regional (e.g. city or county-level) projections of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) epidemic under various scenarios. Daily projections with uncertainty bounds are made for hospitalizations, ICU use active cases, and total cases. As detailed below, LEMMA allows for a range of user-specified parameterizations (including on the model structure) and is fit using case series data of COVID-19 hospital and ICU census, hospital admissions, deaths, cases and seroprevalence.

As of LEMMA 2.0, vaccine and variant modeling is now supported - see documentation at [LEMMA's website](https://localepi.github.io/LEMMA/).
