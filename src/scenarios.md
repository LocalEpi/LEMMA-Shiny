# Scenarios

Select a California county and run a potential scenario.

  * **Vaccine** uptake: select vaccine uptake proportion (vaccination will continue in model until this uptake percentage is reached) for each age group. Values outside of [0,100] will be clipped to those min/max values.
  * **UK variant growth rate**: select the growth rate of the B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2
  * **BR variant growth rate**: select the growth rate of the P.1 variant of SARS-CoV-2
  * **Reopening**: the proportion of pre-pandemic activity that will be returned to after full reopening
  * **Daily increase in available doses (mRNA vaccines)**: the daily rate of increase in available mRNA (Pfizer & Moderna) vaccine doses. If set to 0, available doses remain at baseline.
  * **Daily increase in available doses (J&J vaccine)**: the daily rate of increase in available Johnson & Johnson vaccine doses. If set to 0, available doses remain at baseline.
  
After selecting the settings, the scenario can be run. Please wait while data is downloaded and LEMMA is run. After the model has finished, PDF and Excel results can be downloaded.
