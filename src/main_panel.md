We have moved our model fitting from R to Stan. Our Stan implementation is based on the “Santa Cruz County COVID-19 Model” [https://github.com/jpmattern/seir-covid19](https://github.com/jpmattern/seir-covid19) by Jann Paul Mattern (UC Santa Cruz) and Mikala Caton (Santa Cruz County Health Services Agency). We are very grateful to Paul and Mikala for generously sharing their code and helping us.
